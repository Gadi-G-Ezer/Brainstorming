    Write the one-line function cleaning_right that receives a list of strings, cleans this mess up! That is, it returns a new list
with the original strings – after cleaning their right edges.
Note: in case the original string had ended with one of the ‘c’, ‘o’, ‘f’, ‘e’ characters before the coffee was spilled – you
can treat it as mess and clean it up.
